title: Different textAppearances of TextView in Android
---

The other day I was looking for how I could change the size of the text in my textviews.

We just need to work on the attribute: "**android:textAppearance**" of the tag "**TextView**".

And there are 3 sizes :

* android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceLarge"
* android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceMedium"
* android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceSmall"

Or we also have  :

* android:textSize:"20dp"
