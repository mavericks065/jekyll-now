Last week I went to Agile Australia Sydney. As usual this is a very inspiring event that gives some perspective and where people can really talk and exchange on methodologies and agile subjects.

You can find below the sketchnotes of some presentations I attended to.

Thanks to OCTO Technology for giving me a day at this great event.
