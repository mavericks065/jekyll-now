This blog is the expression of my thoughts. I'm talking about issues I have met during my previous experiences as well as some of my diggings in certain areas of IT development and technical / agile coaching.

# Who am I ?

My name is Nicolas Guignard and I am a Principal Engineer at OnlinePajak.

Passionate about IT, I forged my experience from startups to multinationals. I have worked on different application architectures especially in the Java world (JEE, Web, Scala) but not only, and have a good knowledge of all the associated software components such as front-end, real-time application using Kafka, or Big data analysis using Spark.
In addition to my interest for software development, I'm an adept of Agile and Lean practices as well as software craftsmanship practices.  

During my days off I like to develop on web apps, mobile apps and different new technologies in order to keep discovering and learning new things.
